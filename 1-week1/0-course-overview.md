# Course Overview

The syllabus (available on blackboard) is the most authoritative and up-to-date place for information about the schedule and / or policies.  You are responsible for reviewing it on a regular basis!  The instructor will strive to notify you of any updates.

## Class Flow

* This is a flipped class – you are expected to review Jupyter Notebooks and Readings for the week  _before_ class
  * Every week will include a simple assignment, due before class, that will help guide your work through the materials
* Class time will be devoted to answering your questions and working through exercises
  * Most work will be done in pairs
* I will call on several people randomly (5-7 people as necessary) in each class. Everyone will be called on an equivalent number of times in a semester, and your answers will determine your participation grade (20 points total). If you are not present and have not been excused, you will receive a 0 for that question. You may receive partial or no credit if your answer is not of sufficient quality.
  
## Assignments (IST707)

* **10 assignments \(40 points total\)**
  * 11 weekly assignments - these are simple assignments (~0.9 point each)
  * 3 larger assignments - varying exercises applying techniques covered (10 points each) 
* **Group Project \(40 points total\):**
  * Teams of 3\-5
  * No individual projects\!

## Large Assignment / Report Format

* Include one or both of:
  * A Jupyter notebook with code
  * A Markdown file for accompanying narrative text
* __NO WORD DOCUMENTS OR PDFs__
* __Notebook Format__
  * Rubrics will be provided for each notebook indicating required sections
  * Notebooks should only include:
    * Well documented\, runnable code and results
    * Markdown sections explaining each section of code
  * 2 – 5 pages\, professionally written
* __Markdown format__
  * No spelling or grammar errors\, any equations properly formatted; see [GitHub’s Markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github)
* ***Assignments not following these formatting guidelines will be returned without grading***

## Group Project

* End\-to\-end ML Project: Pick your own data and problem\.  Use any techniques you want\.  Produce a final \(10\-12\) page report\.
* Milestones:
  * __Project Checkpoint 1 \(5 points\):__ Proposal
  * __Project Checkpoint 2 \(10 points\):__ Data description and analysis plan
  * __Project Checkpoint 3 \(5 points\)__ : Final Presentation
  * __Project Final Turn\-in \(20 points; end of exam period\)__
